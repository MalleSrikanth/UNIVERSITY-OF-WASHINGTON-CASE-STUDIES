It means that the quality metric (to be covered in Module 3) failed to improve in the last iteration of the run. The difficulty arises as the sentiment model puts too much weight on extremely rare words. A way to rectify this is to apply regularization, to be covered in Module 4. Regularization lessens the effect of extremely rare words. For the purpose of this assignment, however, please proceed with the model above."
